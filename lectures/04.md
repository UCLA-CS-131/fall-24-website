## Intermediate Haskell

Now that we've covered the basics of Haskell, let's get into some more intermediate topics!

### List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are a compact yet extraordinarily powerful syntax to create lists.

Semiformally, here's a definition:

> A list comprehension is a F.P. construct that lets you easily create a new list based on one or more existing lists.
> With a list comprehension, you specify the following inputs:
> 1. One or more input lists that you want to draw from (these are called "**generators**")
> 2. A set of filters on the input lists (these are called "**guards**")
> 3. A **transformation** applied to the inputs before items are added to the output list.

Carey created a neat animation that maps some Python-like pseudocode into what a Haskell list comprehension looks like on slide 50.

The pseudocode is as follows:
```
process(input_list):
  output_list = []
  for each x in input_list:
       if guard1(x) == True and guard2(x) then
          z = f(x)
          output_list.append(z)
  return output_list

```

Here is the general format of a list comprehension:
```haskell
output_list = [ f(x) | x <- input_list, guard1(x), guard2(x)]
```

Try to map this directly onto the python pseudocode to get a good idea of what's going on (or watch the aforementioned animation on slide 50). We call the `x <- input_list` part a generator.

Comprehensions can also use multiple input lists and guards! 

{: .note}
If you happen to be familiar with [set-builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation) from math classes, comprehensions are similar (see section on programming languages for a side-by-side comparison).

#### Simple Examples
{: .no_toc }

Here are some simple examples:

```hs
-- comp.hs
-- Generate squares of 2 thru 7
squares = [x^2 | x <- [2..7]]

-- Generate products of two lists
prods = [x*y | x <- [3,7], y <- [2,4,6]]

-- Generate combinations of strings
nouns = ["party","exam","studying"]
adjs = ["lit","brutal","chill"]
combos = [adj ++ " " ++ noun |
          adj <- adjs, noun <- nouns]

-- Generate combinations of tuples
menu = [(oz,flavor) |
   oz <- [4,6],
  flavor <- ["Choc","Earwax","Booger"]]
```

Now if we load these expressions into ghci:

```console
ghci> :load comp.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( comp.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
ghci> squares
[4,9,16,25,36,49]

ghci> prods
[6,12,18,14,28,42]

ghci> combos
["lit party","lit exam","lit studying","brutal party","brutal exam","brutal studying","chill party","chill exam","chill studying"]

ghci> menu
[(4,"Choc"),(4,"Earwax"),(4,"Booger"),(6,"Choc"),(6,"Earwax"),(6,"Booger")]
```

In cases like `prods` where we have multiple input lists, you can think of it as a nested for loop. In other words, we can translate prods to the following pseudocode:

```
process(xs, ys):
  output_list = []
  for each x in xs:
    for each y in ys:
      z = x * y
      output_list.append(z)
  return output_list
```

#### Advanced Examples
{: .no_toc }

Here some more examples, this time with guards.

```haskell
-- comp.hs

-- Generate first 5 #s divisible by 29
-- between 1000 and infinity
div_by_29 = take 5 [x | x <- [1000..],
             (mod x 29) == 0]

-- Extract all non-uppercase chars
lies = "nerds EAT rockS!"
truth = [ c | c <- lies,
          not (elem c ['A'..'Z'])] 

-- Generate right triangles
right_triangle_tuples = [ (a,b,c) | 
     a <- [1..10], b <- [a..10], c <- [b..10],
     a^2+b^2==c^2 ] 
```

Now we load into ghci:

```console
ghci> :load comp.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( comp.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
ghci> div_by_29
[1015,1044,1073,1102,1131]
```

Here we get a list of the first five numbers larger than 1000 that are evenly divisible by 29.

```console
ghci> truth
"nerds  rock!"
```

As expected, we filter out all characters that are uppercase.

```console
ghci> right_triangel_tuples
[(3, 4, 5), (6, 8, 10)]
```

Here we create a list of tuples where a is between 1 to 10, b is greater than a and up to 10, and c is greater than b and up to 10 and where the three could form the sides of a right triangle.

{: .note} 
A generator that references a variable from an earlier generator is called a dependent generator.

#### Comprehensions in Action
{: .no_toc }

Think back to CS 32... do you remember quick sort? In short, it's an efficient divide and conquer sorting algorithm. We can very easily implement it using list comprehensions in Haskell!

Quicksort involves:
1. Choosing a pivot value
2. Partitioning the list so that all elements less than the pivot come before it and all elements greater come after
3. Finally, we recursively sort the left and right sides of the pivot until we reach our base case (if the list is empty)

This is a Haskell implementation utilizing list comprehensions:

```haskell
-- Quicksort in eight lines! 
qsort lst 
 | lst == [] = []
 | otherwise = (qsort less_eq) ++ [pivot] ++ (qsort greater)
 where
    pivot = head lst
    rest_lst = tail lst
    less_eq = [a | a <- rest_lst, a <= pivot]    
    greater = [a | a <- rest_lst, a > pivot]
```

You can see that we pick the pivot to be the first element of the list. We then retrieve all elements less than (or equal to) the list and assign it the `less_eq` binding and all elements greater and assign it to `greater`. Finally, in our recursive step we concatenate the result of sorting `less_eq` to the pivot value and to the result of sorting `greater`. Our base case covers the empty list. Pretty neat! 

### Pattern Matching

Now, we'll switch gears to an even more powerful type of syntactic sugar called **pattern matching**. While it's not directly related to functions (or indeed, functional programming), it draws heavy inspiration from functional programming principles. In particular, it'll make list and tuple processing easy!

First, we'll explore parameter-based pattern matching, where:

- we define multiple versions of the same function
- each version of the function must have the same number and types of arguments
- when the function is called, Haskell checks each definition in-order from top to bottom, and calls the *first* function which has matching parameters

#### Pattern Matching with Constants

Let's start with matching constant values: we can place constants instead of the name of an expected argument.

```hs
-- genz.hs
course_critic :: String -> String -> String
course_critic "Carey" "CS131" = 
  "Get ready for pop-tarts and Haskell!"
course_critic "Eggert" course =
  course ++ " is gonna be difficult."
course_critic prof "cs131" =
  "I hope you like coding in 20 languages!"
course_critic prof course = 
  course ++ " with " ++ prof ++ " is fun!"
```

In the function above, the first version has `"Carey"` in the place of the first argument. It only runs when user passes in `"Carey"` for the `name` argument. The same rule applies to other versions.

Here are two straightforward calls:

```console
ghci> :load genz
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( genz.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.

ghci> course_critic "Smallberg" "CS32"
"CS32 with Smallberg is fun!"

ghci> course_critic "Carey" "CS131"
"Get ready for pop-tarts and Haskell!"
```

Here's a more tricky call, where it *could* match two different versions:

```
ghci> course_critic "Eggert" "CS131"
"CS131 is gonna be difficult!"
```

Here, we use the Eggert version since it's defined *first*. Order matters!

Pattern matching with constants works with other types, like numbers or tuples. There is no limit on how many constant patterns you can have:

```hs
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

list_len :: [a] -> Int
list_len [] = 0
list_len lst = 1 + list_len (tail lst)

exp :: (Int, Int) -> Int
exp (_, 0) = 1
exp (base, exponent) = base ^ exponent
```

In the `exp` example, we use pattern matching to make processing a tuple much easier! Notice that we can use `_`'s as wild cards i.e. if you don't care what a value will be and don't want to bind it to a variable. We could have used the `fst` and `snd` functions, but pattern matching allows for a much cleaner syntax!

{: .note}
Remember last lecture when we said we'd get to extracting values from larger tuples? Well, here it is! You can use pattern matching to extract any element from an n-tuple.

New learners are often tempted to write code like:

```hs
tuple_eq (a, a) = True   -- WRONG!!!
tuple_eq _ = False
```

Haskell will complain about "conflicting definitions for `'a'`" on the first line. To compare the two values obtained from pattern matching, they have to be bound to different names and compared afterwards.

```hs
-- using guards
tuple_eq (a, b)
  | a == b = True
  | otherwise = False

-- or, use (==) directly
tuple_eq (a, b) = a == b
```

This differs from Prolog, a language we'll explore much later in the course.

{: .note }
You might've noticed that `_` is the exception to the above rule. Haskell has some special logic for `_` -- it doesn't perform an actual binding, so you can use multiple `_` in a tuple with no problems!

#### Pattern Matching with Lists

We can apply similar logic to pattern matching with lists. Here, we'll rely on the cons operator (`:`) to form our structure. Something of the form `x:xs` matches the head `x` (first item) and the tail `xs` (last item); we can think of it as matching the entire list of `x : xs`!

```hs
-- lists.hs
-- Extract the first item from a list
get_first_item (first:rest) = 
   "The first item is " ++ (show first)

-- Extract all but the first item of a list
get_rest_items (first:rest) = 
   "The last n-1 items are " ++ (show rest)

-- Extract the second item from a list
get_second_item (first:second:rest) = 
   "The second item is " ++ (show second)
```

`get_second_item` comes naturally from our view of pattern matching: we can think of this as "inverse cons" for `x : (y : xs)`, which means that `x` is the head, and `y` is the next item after the head. Note that it is convention to always use `(x:xs)`, `(x:y:xs)` etc. when pattern matching! 

{: .note}
The `show` function converts built-in Haskell types into a String that can be printed or concatenated with another String.

```console
ghci> :load lists
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( lists.hs, interpreted )
ghci> get_first_item [5,10,15,20]
5

ghci> get_rest_items [5,10,15,20]
[10,15,20]

ghci> get_second_item [5,10,15,20]
10

ghci> get_rest_items [5]
[]
```

We can also use the constant `[]` in place of the tail. As you'd expect, this only matches patterns where the tail is *exactly* the empty list.

```hs
-- favs.hs
favorites :: [String] -> String
favorites [] = "You have no favorites."
favorites (x:[]) = "Your favorite is " ++ x
favorites (x:y:[]) = "You have two favorites: "
 ++ x ++ " and " ++ y
favorites ("chocolate":xs) =
  "You have many favs, but chocolate is #1!"
favorites (x:y:_) =
   "You have at least three favorites!"
```


```console
ghci> :load favs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( favs.hs, interpreted )
ghci> favorites []
"You have no favorites."

ghci> favorites ["chocolate"]
"Your favorite is chocolate"

ghci> favorites ["mint","earwax"]
"You have two favorites: mint and earwax"

ghci> favorites ["chocolate","egg","dirt"]
"You have many favs, but chocolate is #1!"

ghci> favorites ["tea","coffee","carrot"]
"You have at least three favorites!"
```

Broadly, pattern matching with lists makes our code more concise and readable! Consider our previous guard-based `sm0lest`:

```hs
sm0lest lst
 | lst == [] = error "empty list"
 | length lst == 1 = first
 | otherwise = min first (sm0lest rest)
 where
   first = head lst
   rest = tail lst
```

With pattern matching, the logic becomes more compact!

```hs
sm0lest [] = error "empty list"
sm0lest [x] = x
sm0lest (x:xs) = min x (sm0lest xs)
```

The same applies to the following reverse list example:

```hs
-- Reverse a list w/o pattern matching
rev lst
 | lst == [] = []
 | otherwise = (rev rest) ++ [first]
 where
  first = head lst
  rest  = tail lst

-- Reverse a list with pattern matching
rev [] = []
rev (x:xs) = (rev xs) ++ [x]
```

{: .note }
This `reverse` algorithm is not optimal; it has `O(N^2)` complexity (in the length of the list). Can you figure out an `O(N)` algorithm?

#### Pattern Matching Challenge
{: .no_toc }

Fill in the blanks for the following function, which takes the first n items from a list!

```haskell
-- Take the first n items from a list
-- take_n 3 [2,4..20] 🡪 [2,4,6]

take_n num  ___  = []
take_n 0 lst =  ___
take_n n (x:xs) = ___ : take_n ___ xs
```

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

<pre>
-- Take the first n items from a list
-- take_n 3 [2,4..20] 🡪 [2,4,6]

take_n num  []  = []
take_n 0 lst =  []  
take_n n (x:xs) = x : take_n (n-1) xs
</pre>
</details>

#### Influence

Pattern matching is mostly used in functional languages, but it's notably been adopted by Python and Rust.

Python added pattern matching *very recently* (in [version `3.10`](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html), released in 2021). Python's pattern matching works on tuples, lists, dictionaries, and more! Python is a *dynamically* typed language, so match cases can have different types.

```python
def func(val):  # Python pattern matching example
  match val:
    case (0, x):        # match tuple w/first elem zero
        print(f"Tuple of 0 and {x}")
    case ['a', x, 'c']: # match list w/3 elems: 'a', ??, 'c'
        print(f"List of a, {x}, and c")
    case [1, 2, *rest]: # seq of: 1, 2, ... other elements
        print(f'A list with 1, 2, and *{rest}')
    case {'foo': bar}:  # match dict w/key 'foo'
        print(f"foo maps to {bar} ")
    case _:
        print('no match')
```

Rust has almost always had pattern matching. It's statically typed, so this example looks quite like Haskell. 

```rust
match vtree_type {
  VTreeType::LeftLinear => VTree::left_linear(vars),
  VTreeType::RightLinear => VTree::right_linear(vars),
  VTreeType::EvenSplit(num) => VTree::even_split(vars, num),
  VTreeType::FromDTree => {
    let dtree = DTree::from_cnf(&cnf, &VarOrder::linear_order(cnf.num_vars()));
    VTree::from_dtree(&dtree).unwrap()
  }
}
```

### Type Variables Challenge
{: .no_toc}

Here's a function that returns the last value in a list of *any* type.

```haskell
get_last_item lst = 
  head (reverse lst)
```

Now, here is its type signature:

```haskell
get_last_item :: [t] -> t
```

You might be wondering... *what the heck is a t*?

Turns out this is another neat feature of Haskell called a type variable! Type variables are similar to generics in other langauges; they let you pass in any type that you want. In this case, since we have `t` as a parameter and the return type, we know the function must take a list of some type and return an element of the same type. There are also cases where the opposite is true. Consider the following:

```haskell
flipFlop :: t1 -> t2 -> ________
flipFlop    x     y  =  (y,  x)
```

Try to fill in the blank using your intuition!

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

<pre>
flipFlop :: t1 -> t2 -> (t2, t1)
flipFlop    x     y  =  (y,  x)
</pre>
</details>

{: .note}
Nothing prevents types t1 and t2 from being the same type!  So `flipFlop 10 20` is fine! However, it would be impossible to pass `flipFlopSame 10 "twenty"` if the type signature was `flipFlopSame :: t -> t -> (t, t)`.

So in summary: you can think of a type variable as a generic or a template type.[^1] We'll refine this notion in a later lecture.

What's cool is that we didn't have to do anything special - it just works out of the box! **And, we didn't even need to tell Haskell that it's generic**: the type system figured it out by itself!

[^1]: You may be thinking to yourself: is this polymorphism (or generic programming) at runtime, or is a copy of this function generated for each type? In Haskell, it's the former: there is one version of the language that "just works" for all types. This is similar to how Java does it. In other languages, like C++ or Rust, generics are compile-time: a copy of the function is made for each type that uses it (this is called [monomorphization](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/backend/monomorph.html)). We will be learning more about the different types of generic programming later on in the class!

### Type Classes Challenge

Consider the `bigger` function, which returns the larger of its two arguments:

```console
ghci> bigger x y = if x > y then x else y
ghci> bigger 10 5
10
ghci> bigger "cs" "math"
"math"
```

If we request the type of `bigger`, we get the following:

```console
ghci> :t bigger
bigger :: Ord a => a -> a -> a
```

This looks new! This is another great feature of Haskell: type classes. Type classes provide a way to provide contraints to generic types. In particular in this case, `Ord a => a` requires the type `a` to conform to the `Ord` type class.

`Ord` is short for Ordered, meaning `a` must be of a type that is orderable through comparison e.g. numbers, strings.

Here's another example:

```console
ghci> div5 x = x / 5
ghci> :t div5
div5 :: Fractional a => a -> a
```

Here `a` must conform to the `Fractional` type class, meaning it must be a floating point number. Pretty cool! 

{: .note}
You'll see these used in a lot of built in functions, so best get used to them!

### First-class and Higher-Order Functions

One key characteristic of functional languages is that they enable you to treat a function just like any other variable. In other words, functions are *first-class*!

Formally speaking, a language with **first-class functions** treats functions like any other data. They can be:

- stored in variables or data structures
- passed as arguments to other functions
- returned as values by functions

As we'll see, these features enable more **efficient program decomposition** and allow functions to **generate new functions from scratch**
!

One consequence of first-class functions is something called a **higher-order function**, which is either:

- a function that accepts another function as an argument, and/or
- a function that returns another function as its return value

The following example exercises the property of passing functions as arguments:

```hs
-- first.hs
insult :: String -> String
insult name = name ++ " is so cringe!"

praise :: String -> String
praise name = name ++ " is dank!"

talk_to :: String -> (String -> String) -> String
talk_to name talk_func
  | name == "Carey" = "No comment."
  | otherwise = (talk_func name)
```

`talk_to` is a higher-order function: its second argument, `talk_func`, is itself a function that takes in a `String` and returns a `String`. That's reflected in its type: `(String -> String)`; take note of the parentheses in the type declaration to denote a function-type parameter. 

Let's give it a shot:

```console
ghci> :load first
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( first.hs, interpreted )
ghci> talk_to "Devan" praise
"Devan is dank!"
ghci> talk_to "Brendan" insult
"Brendan is so cringe!"
ghci> talk_to "Carey" insult
"No comment."
```

This second example *returns* a function!

```hs
-- first.hs
get_pickup_func :: Int -> (String -> String)
get_pickup_func born
  | born >= 1997 && born <= 2012 = pickup_genz
  | otherwise = pickup_other
 where
   pickup_genz name = name ++ ", you've got steez!"
   pickup_other name = name ++ ", you've got style!"
```

The higher-order function `get_pickup_func` returns different functions according to the argument `born`. The returned function can be stored into variable and invoked later.

```console
ghci> :load first
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( first.hs, interpreted )
ghci> pickup_fn = get_pickup_func 2003
ghci> pickup_fn "Jayathi"
"Jayathi, you've got steez!"
ghci> get_pickup_func 1971 "Carey"
"Carey, you've got style!"
```

Although first-class and higher-order functions originate from functional programming, they are a pillar of virtually all modern programming languages.

Their use-cases include:

- providing comparison functions for sorting
- as callbacks when events trigger
- enabling multi-threading

Some examples:

```js
// JavaScript
const sortByDate = (a,b) => {
  if (a.date < b.date) return -1;
  if (a.date > b.date ) return 1;
  return 0;
}

movies.sort(sortByDate);
```

```js
// JavaScript
const handleClick = function (event) {
   alert("A button was clicked!");
};

// Select big button from HTML web page
var button = document.querySelector('#big-button');
// Specify what func should be called when it's clicked
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

```cpp
// C++
void foo()      { /* does some work & returns */ }
void bar(int x) { /* does some work & returns */ }

int main() {
  std::thread thread1(foo), thread2(bar,42);

  // Run main, foo and bar until they all finish
  thread1.join(); // pause until foo() finishes
  thread2.join(); // pause until bar() finishes
  std::cout << "main, foo and bar completed.\n";
}
```

We'll pick back up with first class functions next time! Hopefully, you're beginning to appreciate the power of functional programming! See you next time 😼👍


## Appendix

Everything that follows are notes for the old version of this lecture from last year! It was originally written by the wonderful founding CS 131 TA Matt Wang.

## Pattern Matching
{: .no_toc}
Now, we'll switch gears to an even more powerful type of syntactic sugar called **pattern matching**. While it's not directly related to functions (or indeed, functional programming), it draws heavy inspiration from functional programming principles. In particular, it'll make list and tuple processing easy!

First, we'll explore parameter-based pattern matching, where:

- we define multiple versions of the same function
- each version of the function must have the same number and types of arguments
- when the function is called, Haskell checks each definition in-order from top to bottom, and calls the *first* function which has matching parameters

### Pattern Matching with Constants
{: .no_toc}
Let's start with matching constant values: we can place constants instead of the name of an expected argument.

```hs
-- genz.hs
genz_critic :: String -> String -> String
genz_critic "Carey" word =
  "Oh Carey... OK boomer!"
genz_critic name "lit" =
  name ++ ", you're a lit genz-er"
genz_critic name "wrekt" =
  name ++ ", git wrekt cheugy"
genz_critic name word =
  name ++ ", " ++ word ++ " is not gucci!"
```

In the function above, the first version has `"Carey"` in the place of the first argument. It only runs when user passes in `"Carey"` for the `name` argument. The same rule applies to other versions.

Here are two straightforward calls:

```console
ghci> :load genz
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( genz.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.

ghci> genz_critic "Ed" "wrekt"
"Ed, git wrekt cheugy"

ghci> genz_critic "Paul" "unix"
"Paul, unix is not gucci!"
```

Here's a more tricky call, where it *could* match two different versions:

```
ghci> genz_critic "Carey" "lit"
"Oh Carey... OK boomer!
```

Here, we use the Carey version since it's defined *first*. Order matters!

Pattern matching with constants work with other types, like numbers or lists. There is no limit on how many constant patterns you can have:

```hs
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

list_len :: [a] -> Int
list_len [] = 0
list_len lst = 1 + list_len (tail lst)

has_this_many_eyes :: Int -> String
has_this_many_eyes 1 = "Cyclops"
has_this_many_eyes 2 = "Pupper"
has_this_many_eyes 3 = "Sphenodon Punctatus"
has_this_many_eyes 4 = "A nerd with glasses"
has_this_many_eyes n = "A freak!"
```

### Pattern Matching with Tuples
{: .no_toc}
One powerful use-case of pattern matching is with tuples; since we know how many items are in the tuple, we can "match" each item!

```hs
-- tuples.hs

-- Original way
exp :: (Int,Int) -> Int
exp t = (fst t) ^ (snd t)

-- Version #2: With pattern matching
expv2 :: (Int,Int) -> Int
expv2 (a,b) = a ^ b

-- Version #3: Adding a constant parameter
expv3 :: (Int,Int) -> Int
expv3 (a,0) = 1
expv3 (a,b) = a ^ b
```

Here, the advantage of versions 2 and 3 are their conciseness: we didn't need to think about `fst` or `snd`!

Earlier, students asked how to extract values out of tuples that have more than 2 elements. With pattern matching, we can do that now!

```hs
-- tuples.hs
-- Extract the first value of a tuple
extract_1st :: (type1,type2,type3) -> type1
extract_1st (a,_,_) = a

-- Extract the second value of a tuple
extract_2nd :: (type1,type2,type3) -> type2
extract_2nd (_,b,_) = b

-- Extract the third value of a tuple
extract_3rd :: (type1,type2,type3) -> type3
extract_3rd (_,_,c) = c
```

```console
ghci> :load tuples
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( tuples.hs, interpreted )
ghci> extract_3rd ("q",5,1.7)
1.7
```

The underscore `_` is a wildcard: anything can match this item. In particular, note that we don't even care about its type!

New learners are often tempted to write code like:

```hs
tuple_eq (a, a) = True   -- WRONG!!!
tuple_eq _ = False
```

Haskell will complain about "conflicting definitions for `'a'`" on the first line. To compare the two values obtained from pattern matching, they have to be bound to different names and compared afterwards.

```hs
-- using guards
tuple_eq (a, b)
  | a == b = True
  | otherwise = False

-- or, use (==) directly
tuple_eq (a, b) = a == b
```

This differs from Prolog, a language we'll explore much later in the course.

{: .note }
You might've noticed that `_` is the exception to the above rule. Haskell has some special logic for `_` -- it doesn't perform an actual binding, so you can use multiple `_` in a tuple with no problems!

### Pattern Matching with Lists
{: .no_toc}
We can apply similar logic to pattern matching with lists. Here, we'll rely on the cons operator (`:`) to form our structure. Something of the form `x:xs` matches the head `x` (first item) and the tail `xs` (last item); we can think of it as matching the entire list of `x : xs`!

```hs
-- lists.hs
-- Extract the first item from a list
get_first :: [a] -> a
get_first (x:xs) = x

-- Extract all but the first item of a list
get_rest :: [a] -> [a]
get_rest (x:xs) = xs

-- Extract the second item from a list
get_second :: [a] -> a
get_second (x:y:xs) = y
```

`get_second` comes naturally from our view of pattern matching: we can think of this as "inverse cons" for `x : (y : xs)`, which means that `x` is the head, and `y` is the next item after the head.

```console
ghci> :load lists
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( lists.hs, interpreted )
ghci> get_first [5,10,15,20]
5

ghci> get_rest [5,10,15,20]
[10,15,20]

ghci> get_second [5,10,15,20]
10

ghci> get_rest [5,6]
[6]

ghci> get_rest [5]
[]
```

We can also use the constant `[]` in place of the tail. As you'd expect, this only matches patterns where the tail is *exactly* the empty list.

```hs
-- favs.hs
favorites :: [String] -> String
favorites [] = "You have no favorites."
favorites (x:[]) = "Your favorite is " ++ x
favorites (x:y:[]) = "You have two favorites: "
 ++ x ++ " and " ++ y
favorites ("chocolate":xs) =
  "You have many favs, but chocolate is #1!"
favorites (x:y:_) =
   "You have at least three favorites!"
```


```console
ghci> :load favs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( favs.hs, interpreted )
ghci> favorites []
"You have no favorites."

ghci> favorites ["chocolate"]
"Your favorite is chocolate"

ghci> favorites ["mint","earwax"]
"You have two favorites: mint and earwax"

ghci> favorites ["chocolate","egg","dirt"]
"You have many favs, but chocolate is #1!"

ghci> favorites ["tea","coffee","carrot"]
"You have at least three favorites!"
```

There is another notation that uses brackets (`[]`) instead of parens (`()`). It's not used as commonly as the parenthetic version. The core difference here is that it only matches lists of an exact length; each item in the list is just an item (there are no tails, etc.).

```hs
-- lists.hs\
whats_in_your_list [10] =
    "Your list has just 1 value which is 10."
whats_in_your_list [a,b] = "Your list has 2 values: "
    ++ (show a) ++ " and " ++ (show b)
whats_in_your_list [9,_,c] =
    "Starts with 9 and its third item is:"  ++ (show c)
whats_in_your_list _ =
    "Your list had something else in it."
```

```console
ghci> :load lists
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( lists.hs, interpreted )
ghci> whats_in_your_list [10]
"Your list has just 1 value which is 10."

ghci> whats_in_your_list [10,20]
"Your list has 2 values: 10 and 20"

ghci> whats_in_your_list [9,10,20]
"Starts with 9 and its third item is 20."

ghci> whats_in_your_list [9,10,20,30]
"Your list had something else in it."
```

Broadly, pattern matching with lists makes our code more concise and readable! Consider our previous guard-based `sm0lest`:

```hs
sm0lest lst
 | lst == [] = error "empty list"
 | length lst == 1 = first
 | otherwise = min first (sm0lest rest)
 where
   first = head lst
   rest = tail lst
```

With pattern matching, the logic becomes more compact!

```hs
sm0lest [] = error "empty list"
sm0lest [x] = x
sm0lest (x:xs) = min x (sm0lest xs)
```

The same applies to the following reverse list example:

```hs
-- Reverse a list w/o pattern matching
rev lst
 | lst == [] = []
 | otherwise = (rev rest) ++ [first]
 where
  first = head lst
  rest  = tail lst

-- Reverse a list with pattern matching
rev [] = []
rev (x:xs) = (rev xs) ++ [x]
```

{: .note }
This `reverse` algorithm is not optimal; it has `O(N^2)` complexity (in the length of the list). Can you figure out an `O(N)` algorithm?

### Influence
{: .no_toc}
Pattern matching is mostly used in functional languages, but it's notably been adopted by Python and Rust.

Python added pattern matching *very recently* (in [version `3.10`](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html), released in 2021). Python's pattern matching works on tuples, lists, dictionaries, and more! Python is a *dynamically* typed language, so match cases can have different types.

```python
def func(val):  # Python pattern matching example
  match val:
    case (0, x):        # match tuple w/first elem zero
        print(f"Tuple of 0 and {x}")
    case ['a', x, 'c']: # match list w/3 elems: 'a', ??, 'c'
        print(f"List of a, {x}, and c")
    case [1, 2, *rest]: # seq of: 1, 2, ... other elements
        print(f'A list with 1, 2, and *{rest}')
    case {'foo': bar}:  # match dict w/key 'foo'
        print(f"foo maps to {bar} ")
    case _:
        print('no match')
```

Rust has almost always had pattern matching. It's statically typed, so this example looks quite like Haskell. 

```rust
match vtree_type {
  VTreeType::LeftLinear => VTree::left_linear(vars),
  VTreeType::RightLinear => VTree::right_linear(vars),
  VTreeType::EvenSplit(num) => VTree::even_split(vars, num),
  VTreeType::FromDTree => {
    let dtree = DTree::from_cnf(&cnf, &VarOrder::linear_order(cnf.num_vars()));
    VTree::from_dtree(&dtree).unwrap()
  }
}
```

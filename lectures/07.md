Matt here! After hearing from Brian Kernighan (which was awesome!), we covered slides 16-52 of [Data Palooza](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/196AgYxc9mFypCwZwHAMNtbylKsfsANX8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101757866260235503028&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Types

In this section, we will take a deep dive into typing and type checking. You should hopefully get a much better idea of the implications of a type system.

Before proceeding, it's worth asking if are types even necessary to create a programming language?

Yes! It is possible to have a language with no types. Assembly languages are one such example of languages with no type system. They just have a register that holds a 32 (or 64) bit value. The value could represent anything (an integer, float, pointer, etc.). [BLISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLISS) is another example of a language with no types.

```
MODULE E1 (MAIN = CTRL) =
BEGIN
FORWARD ROUTINE
    CTRL,
    STEP;
ROUTINE CTRL =
BEGIN
    EXTERNAL ROUTINE
        GETNUM,     ! Input a number from terminal
        PUTNUM;     ! Output a number to terminal
    LOCAL
        X,          ! Storage for input value
        Y;          ! Storage for output value
    GETNUM(X);
    Y = STEP(.X);
    PUTNUM(.Y)
    END;
ROUTINE STEP(A) =
    (.A+1);
END
ELUDOM
```

But virtually all modern languages have a type system, since it makes programming so much easier and safer.

Must every variable have a type in a typed language?

No! In Python for example, variables are not associated with types.

```python
# Python
def foo(q):
  if q:
    x = "What's my type?" # string
  ...
  x = 10 # int
```

In general, many dynamically typed (don't worry, we will cover them in this lecture) languages don't associate variables with types. However, note that a value is **always** associated with a type.

Types can broadly be classified into two categories, primitive and composite. Primitive data types are a set of types from which other types are constructed. Composite data types are those types which can be constructed using primitive and composite data types.

Examples of primitive data types:

- Integers
- Booleans
- Characters
- Enumerated types (Enums)
- Floats
- Pointers

Examples of derived data types:

- Arrays
- Structs
- Variants/Unions
- Objects
- Tuples
- Containers

There can also be data types that don't fall into either category.

- Functions
- Generic types
- Boxed types

{: .note}
A boxed type is just an object whose only data member is a *primitive* (like an `int` or a `float`)

```cpp
class Integer {
 public:
   int get() const { return val_; }
 private:
   int val_;
};
```

In languages like Python that pass by object reference, this lets you "change" a primitive type's value!

### Type checking

Type checking is the process of verifying and enforcing constriants on types. Type checking can occur during compile time (static) or during run time (dynamic). The language can also specify the degree of strictness for type checking (strong and weak type checking). We will go into more detail on all of these topics.

| Type checking approaches. Type checkers can be classified on the basis of whether they run during compile time or during run time. Type checkers can also be classified on the basis of strictness (strong or weak). |

### Static typing

Static typing is the process of verifying that all operations in a program are consistent with the types of the operands prior to program execution. Types can either be explicitly specified (like in C++) or can be inferred from code (like in Haskell). For inferred types, if the type checker cannot assign distinct types to all variables, functions, and expressions or cannot verify type safety, then it generates an error.
But if a program type checks, then it means the code is (largely) type safe, and few if any run time checks need to be performed.

{: .note }
To support static typing, a language **must have** a fixed type bound to each variable at the time of definition.

#### Type Inference

Type inference refers to the automatic detection of types of expressions or variables in a language. Consider the following example:

```cpp
void foo(_____ x, _____ y) {
  cout << x + 10;
  cout << y + " is a string!";
}
```

What would be the types of `x` and `y`? `int` and `string`, right! The compiler can infer that `y` is an `string` from the fact that we perform the operation `y + " is a string"`, which is only valid if `y` is a `string`. What about `x`? It seems like `x` can only be an `int`. But consider this example:

```cpp
void foo(_____ x, _____ y) {
  cout << x + 10;
  cout << y + " is a string!";
}
void bar() {
  double d = 3.14;
  foo(d,"barf");
}
```
Here, it makes more sense for `x` to be a `double`. So type inference is actually a complex constraint satisfaction problem.

{: .note }
A fun observation from Matt - because C and C++ allow pointer arithmetic, in theory `x` could also be a pointer. Wonky!

Many statically typed languages now offer some form of type inference. C++ has the `auto` keyword:

```cpp
// C++ type inference with auto
int main() {
  auto x = 3.14159; // x is of type int
  vector<int> v;
  ...

  for (auto item: v) { // item is of type int
    cout << item << endl;
  }

  auto it = v.begin(); // it is of type vector<int>::iterator
  while(it != v.end()) {
    cout << *it << endl;
    ++it;
  }
}
```

{: .note }
Type inference has limitations! Most languages (like C++, Java, or Rust) will struggle with generic types and iterators; you'll be forced to write type annotations in some areas.

Go similarly infers the type of variables from the right-hand-side expression
```go
// GoLang type inference
func main() {
  msg := "I like languages"; // string
  n := 5 // int
  for i := n; i > 0; i-- {
    fmt.Println(msg);
  }
}
```

#### Conservatism

Static type checking is inherently conservative. This means that the static type checker will disallow perfectly valid programs that never violate typing rules.

{: .note }
This is due to the fact that for Turing-complete languages, it is not possible to have a *sound* (meaning all incorrect programs are rejected), *decidable* (meaning that it is possible to write an algorithm that determines whether a program is well-typed), and *complete* (meaning no correct programs are rejected) type system. This follows from [GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems). (Don't worry if you don't understand this, it won't be on the exam :))

For an example, consider the following program:

```cpp
class Mammal {
public:
 virtual void makeNoise() { cout << "Breathe\n"; }
};
class Dog: public Mammal {
public:
 void makeNoise() override { cout << "Ruff\n"; }
 void bite() { cout << "Chomp\n"; }
};
class Cat: public Mammal {
public:
 void makeNoise() override { cout << "Meow!\n"; }
 void scratch() { cout << "Scrape!\n"; }
};

void handlePet(Mammal& m, bool bite, bool scratch) {
 m.makeNoise();
 if (bite)
   m.bite();
 if (scratch)
   m.scratch();
}

int main() {
 Dog spot;
 Cat meowmer;
 handlePet(spot, true, false);
 handlePet(meowmer, false, true);
}
```

The compiler generates an error during the compilation of this code
```console
error: no member named 'scratch' in 'Mammal'
```

even though the code only asks `Dog`s to `bite` and `Cat`s to `scratch`.

**Pros of static type checking**:

- Produces faster code (since we don't have to type check during run time)
- Allows for earlier bug detection (at compile time)
- No need to write custom type checks

**Cons of static type checking**:

- Static typing is conservative and may error our perfectly valid code
- It requires a type checking phase before execution, which can be slow

### Dynamic typing

Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at run time. If the code is attempting an illegal operation on a variable's value, an exception is generated and the program crashes. Here are some examples of dynamic type checking at run time.

```python
def add(x,y):
 print(x + y)

def foo():
 a = 10
 b = "cooties"
 add(a,b)
```

outputs

```console
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

```python
def do_something(x):
 x.quack()

def main():
 a = Lion("Leo")
 do_something(a)
```

outputs

```console
AttributeError: 'Lion' object has no attribute 'quack'
```

Most dynamically typed languages don't require explicit type annotations for variables. This means that a given variable name could refer to values of multiple types over the course of execution of the program.

```python
def guess_my_number(secret_value):
 val = get_number_from_user()

 if val > 100:
   val = "Your guess is too large!"
 else:
   ...
```

#### Type Tags

How does a program written in a dynamically typed language detect type violations?

Well, in dynamically typed languages, **types are associated with values -- not variables**! In other words, variables do not have types in dynamically typed languages.

Usually the compiler/interpreter would use a *type tag*, an extra piece of data stored along with each value that indicates the type of the value.

```python
def add(x,y):
 print(x + y)

def foo():
 a = 10
 b = "cooties"
 add(a, b)
```

So in this example, the compiler would store the fact that the value `a` is pointing to is an `int` with value `10`, and `b` is a `string` with value `cooties`.

Sometimes statically typed languages also need to perform run time type checks. This is most often seen during down-casting (when casting an object from a child class to a parent class). Consider the following example.

```cpp
class Person { ... };
class Student : public Person { ... };
class Doctor : public Person { ... };
void partay(Person *p) {
  Student *s = dynamic_cast<Student *>(p);
  if (s != nullptr)
    s->getDrunkAtParty();
}
int main() {
  Doctor *d = new Doctor("Dr. Fauci");
  partay(d);
  delete d;
}
```

`dynamic_cast` does a run time check to ensure that the type conversion (from `Person*` to `Student*`) we are performing is valid. If it isn't valid, `dynamic_cast` will return `nullptr`.

**Pros of dynamic type checking**:
- Increased flexibility
- Often easier to implement generics that operate on many different types of data
- Simpler code due to fewer type annotations
- Makes for faster prototyping

**Cons of dynamic type checking**:
- We detect errors much later
- Code is slower due to run time type checking
- Requires more testing for the same level of assurance
- No way to guarantee safety across all possible executions (unlike static type checking)

#### Addendum: Dynamic Type Checking in Statically-Typed Languages

Sometimes, dynamic type checking is needed in statically-typed languages:

- when downcasting (in C++)
- when disambiguating variants (think Haskell!)
- (depending on the implementation) potentially in runtime generics

#### Duck Typing

Duck typing emerges as a consequence of dynamic typing. With static typing, we determine the what operations work on a particular value/variable based on the type of the value/variable. But a consequence of dynamic typing is that variables no longer have a fixed type. This means that we can pass a value of any type to a function, and as long as the type of the value implements all of the operations used in the function, the code should work fine.

Consider the following example:

```python
# Python "duck" typing
class Duck:
 def swim(self):
  print("Paddle paddle paddle")

class OlympicSwimmer:
 def swim(self):
  print("Back stroke back stroke")

class Professor:
 def profess(self):
  print("Blah blah blah blah blah")

def process(x):
 x.swim()

def main():
 d = Duck()
 s = OlympicSwimmer()
 p = Professor()
 process(d) # Paddle paddle paddle
 process(s) # Back stroke back stroke
 process(p) # throws AttributeError
```
Since `Duck` and `OlympicSwimmer` both implement the `swim` method, the code works. When it gets to `Professor`, which doesn't implement `swim`, that's when you get the error.

The values you pass to `process` only need to implement `swim`, they do not have to be related to each other. Duck typing has some interesting applications.

#### Supporting enumeration

In Python, you can make any class iterable by just implementing the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.
```python
# Python duck typing for iteration
class Cubes:
  def __init__(self, lower, upper):
    self.upper = upper
    self.n = lower
  def __iter__(self):
    return self
  def __next__(self):
    if self.n < self.upper:
      s = self.n ** 3
      self.n += 1
      return s
    else:
      raise StopIteration

for i in Cubes(1, 4):
  print(i)             # prints 1, 8, 27
```

#### Make any class printable!

In Python, you can make any class printable (using `print`) by just implementing the `__str__` function
```python
# Python duck typing for printing objects
class Duck:
 def __init__(self, name, feathers):
  self.name = name
  self.feathers = feathers

 def __str__(self):
  return self.name + " with " + \
         str(self.feathers) + " feathers."

d = Duck("Daffy", 3)
print(d)
```

#### Make any class comparalbe!

In Python, if you add the `__eq__` method to any class, you can make it's objects "comparable".

```python
# Python duck typing for equality
class Duck:
  def __init__(self, name, feathers):
    self.name = name
    self.feathers = feathers

 def __eq__(self, other):
  return (
    self.name == other.name and
    self.feathers == other.feathers
  )

duck1 = Duck("Carey", 19)
duck2 = Duck("Carey", 19)

if duck1 == duck2:
  print("Same!")
```

Other dynamically typed languages also offer duck typing!

**Ruby**:

```ruby
# ruby duck typing
class Duck
 def quack
  puts "Quack, quack"
 end
end

class Dog
 def quack
  puts "Woof... I mean quack!"
 end
end

animals = [Duck.new,Dog.new]
animals.each do |animal|
 animal.quack()
end
```

**JavaScript**:
```js
// JavaScript duck typing
var cyrile_the_duck = {
  swim: function ()
          { console.log("Paddle paddle!"); },
  color: "brown"
};

var michael_phelps = {
  swim: function ()
          { console.log("Back stroke!"); },
  outfit: "Speedos"
};

function process(who) {
  who.swim();
}

process(cyrile_the_duck);  // Paddle paddle!
process(michael_phelps);   // Back stroke!
```

{: .note }
It is possible to have something similar to duck typing in statically typed languages (like C++) as well. In C++, this is done using templates; there's also runtime generics in Java, Rust's generics system, etc.

### Gradual Typing

Gradual typing is a hybrid approach between static and dynamic typing. It's used by a few well known languages like PHP and TypeScript, so it merits discussion.

In gradual typing, some variables may have explicitly annotated types, while others may not. This allows the type checker to partially verify type safety prior to execution, and perform the rest of the checks during run time.

With gradual typing, you can choose whether to specify a type for variables/parameters. If a variable is untyped, then type errors for that variable are detected at run time. But if a variable is typed, then it's possible to detect some type errors at compile time. But what if we pass an untyped variable as an argument to a typed variable? Look at the following code snipped for a concrete example.

```python
def square(x: int):
  return x * x

def what_happens(y):
  print(square(y))
```

This is actually allowed in gradually typed languages! If you pass an untyped variable as an argument to `what_happens`, the type checker will check for errors during run time. This way, if you do use an invalid type, the program will generate an error the moment an incompatible type is detected.

Let's try and classify a language.
```kotlin
fun greet(name: String) {
  print("Hello, $name!")
}

fun main() {
  var n = "Graciela";
  greet(n);

  n = 10;
}
```

Is this language dynamically, statically or gradually typed, given that the code generates the following error?

```console
The integer literal does not conform to the expected type String
```

**Answer**: Even though it doesn't look like it at first glance, the language is statically typed, since you can't assign `n` to a value of a new type. This means that `n` has a fixed type, and that the language is using type inference. This language is actually Kotlin!


## Strong typing

Now that we have a good idea of static and dynamic typing, we're going to look at the various type checking approaches on the basis of strictness. A strongly typed language ensures that we will **never** have *undefined behaviour* at run time due to type issues. This means that in a strongly typed language, there is no possibility of an unchecked run time type error.

{: .note }
The definition of strong typing is disputed. Many academics argue for a stronger definition (e.g. all conversions between types should be explicit, the language should have explicit type annotations for all variables, etc.). But ultimately while these definitions may make a languages type system stricter, they don't impact the languages type or memory safety.

These are the minimum requirements for a language to be strongly typed:

- **the language is type-safe**: the language will prevent an operation on a variable `x` if `x`s type doesn't support that operation.
```cpp
int x;
Dog d;
a = 5 * d; // Prevented
```
- **the language is memory safe**: the language prevents inappropriate memory accesses (e.g., out-of-bounds array accesses, accessing a dangling pointer)
```cpp
int arr[5], *ptr;
cout << arr[10]; // Prevented
cout << *ptr; // Prevented
```

These can be enforced either statically or dynamically!

Languages usually use a few techniques to implement strong typing:
- before an expression is evaluated, the compiler/interpreter validates that all of the operands used in the expression have compatible types.
- all conversions between different types are checked and if the types are incompatible (e.g., converting an int to a Dog), then an exception will be generated.
- pointers are either set to null or assigned to point at a valid object at creation.
- accesses to arrays are bounds checked; pointer arithmetic is bounds-checked.
- the language ensures objects can't be used after they are destroyed.

In general, strongly typed languages prevent operations on incompatible types or invalid memory.

### Why do we need memory safety?
Why do strongly typed langauges require memory safety? To answer this question, consider the following example in C++ (a weakly typed language).
```cpp
// C++
int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
float salary = 120000.50;

cout << arr[3]; // out-of-bounds access
```
`arr[3]` actually access the value stored in `salary`, since all local variables are stored on the stack. So if a language is not memory safe, then it's possible to access a value (like `salary`) using an invalid type (`int` instead of `float`). Accessing a dangling pointer is another example of how memory safety can violate type safety.

| ![cpp-weak-type]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/lecture-notes/07/ram-image-weak-safety.png) |
| :--: |
| In C++, `arr[3]` would actually access the value stored in `salary` as if it were an integer! |

```cpp
// Accessing a dangling pointer
float *ptr = new float[100];
delete [] ptr;
cout << *ptr; // is this still a float?
```

### Checked type casts
A checked cast is a type cast that results in an exception/error if the conversion is illegal. Let's look at a concrete example in Java, a strongly typed language.
Consider the following snippet of code.
```java
public void petAnimal(Animal a) {
  a.pet(); // Pet the animal

  Dog d = (Dog)a; // Probably a dog, right?
  d.wagTail();    // It'll wag its tail!
}

...

public void takeCareOfCats() {
  Cat c = new Cat("Meowmer");
  petAnimal(c);
}
```
In this case, the program would output a type error saying that `Cat` can't be type cast to `Dog`.
```console
java.lang.ClassCastException: class Cat cannot be cast to class Dog
```
A similar snippet of code in C++ however would run, even though we are dealing with an object of type `Cat`, not `Dog`!
```cpp
void petAnimal(Animal *a) {
  a->pet(); // Pet the animal

  Dog* d = (Dog *)a;
  d->wagTail();
}

...

void takeCareOfCats() {
  Cat c("Meowmer");
  petAnimal(&c);
}
```
When the C++ program actually executes `d->wagTail()`, anything could happen. This is *undefined behaviour* (we will cover undefined behaviour later in this lecture).

Why should we prefer strongly typed languages? Well, they have two main benefits.
- They dramatically reduce software vulnerabilities (e.g. buffer overflows).
- They allow for early detection and fixing of errors/bugs.

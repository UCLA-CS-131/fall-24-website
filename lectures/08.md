### Gradual Typing

Gradual typing is a hybrid approach between static and dynamic typing. It's used by a few well known languages like PHP and TypeScript, so it merits discussion.

In gradual typing, some variables may have explicitly annotated types, while others may not. This allows the type checker to partially verify type safety prior to execution, and perform the rest of the checks during run time.

With gradual typing, you can choose whether to specify a type for variables/parameters. If a variable is untyped, then type errors for that variable are detected at run time. But if a variable is typed, then it's possible to detect some type errors at compile time. But what if we pass an untyped variable as an argument to a typed variable? Look at the following code snipped for a concrete example.

```python
def square(x: int):
  return x * x

def what_happens(y):
  print(square(y))
```

This is actually allowed in gradually typed languages! If you pass an untyped variable as an argument to `what_happens`, the type checker will check for errors during run time. This way, if you do use an invalid type, the program will generate an error the moment an incompatible type is detected.

### Classify That Language: Type Checking

Let's try and classify a language.
```kotlin
fun greet(name: String) {
  print("Hello, $name!")
}

fun main() {
  var n = "Graciela";
  greet(n);

  n = 10;
}
```

Is this language dynamically, statically or gradually typed, given that the code generates the following error?

```console
The integer literal does not conform to the expected type String
```

**Answer**: Even though it doesn't look like it at first glance, the language is statically typed, since you can't assign `n` to a value of a new type. This means that `n` has a fixed type, and that the language is using type inference. This language is actually Kotlin!


## Strong typing

Now that we have a good idea of static and dynamic typing, we're going to look at the various type checking approaches on the basis of strictness. A strongly typed language ensures that we will **never** have *undefined behaviour* at run time due to type issues. This means that in a strongly typed language, there is no possibility of an unchecked run time type error.

{: .note }
The definition of strong typing is disputed. Many academics argue for a stronger definition (e.g. all conversions between types should be explicit, the language should have explicit type annotations for all variables, etc.). But ultimately while these definitions may make a languages type system stricter, they don't impact the languages type or memory safety.

These are the minimum requirements for a language to be strongly typed:

- **the language is type-safe**: the language will prevent an operation on a variable `x` if `x`s type doesn't support that operation.
```cpp
int x;
Dog d;
a = 5 * d; // Prevented
```
- **the language is memory safe**: the language prevents inappropriate memory accesses (e.g., out-of-bounds array accesses, accessing a dangling pointer)
```cpp
int arr[5], *ptr;
cout << arr[10]; // Prevented
cout << *ptr; // Prevented
```

These can be enforced either statically or dynamically!

Languages usually use a few techniques to implement strong typing:
- before an expression is evaluated, the compiler/interpreter validates that all of the operands used in the expression have compatible types.
- all conversions between different types are checked and if the types are incompatible (e.g., converting an int to a Dog), then an exception will be generated.
- pointers are either set to null or assigned to point at a valid object at creation.
- accesses to arrays are bounds checked; pointer arithmetic is bounds-checked.
- the language ensures objects can't be used after they are destroyed.

In general, strongly typed languages prevent operations on incompatible types or invalid memory.

### Why do we need memory safety?
Why do strongly typed langauges require memory safety? To answer this question, consider the following example in C++ (a weakly typed language).
```cpp
// C++
int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
float salary = 120000.50;

cout << arr[3]; // out-of-bounds access
```
`arr[3]` actually access the value stored in `salary`, since all local variables are stored on the stack. So if a language is not memory safe, then it's possible to access a value (like `salary`) using an invalid type (`int` instead of `float`). Accessing a dangling pointer is another example of how memory safety can violate type safety.

| ![cpp-weak-type]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/lecture-notes/07/ram-image-weak-safety.png) |
| :--: |
| In C++, `arr[3]` would actually access the value stored in `salary` as if it were an integer! |

```cpp
// Accessing a dangling pointer
float *ptr = new float[100];
delete [] ptr;
cout << *ptr; // is this still a float?
```

### Checked type casts
A checked cast is a type cast that results in an exception/error if the conversion is illegal. Let's look at a concrete example in Java, a strongly typed language.
Consider the following snippet of code.
```java
public void petAnimal(Animal a) {
  a.pet(); // Pet the animal

  Dog d = (Dog)a; // Probably a dog, right?
  d.wagTail();    // It'll wag its tail!
}

...

public void takeCareOfCats() {
  Cat c = new Cat("Meowmer");
  petAnimal(c);
}
```
In this case, the program would output a type error saying that `Cat` can't be type cast to `Dog`.
```console
java.lang.ClassCastException: class Cat cannot be cast to class Dog
```
A similar snippet of code in C++ however would run, even though we are dealing with an object of type `Cat`, not `Dog`!
```cpp
void petAnimal(Animal *a) {
  a->pet(); // Pet the animal

  Dog* d = (Dog *)a;
  d->wagTail();
}

...

void takeCareOfCats() {
  Cat c("Meowmer");
  petAnimal(&c);
}
```
When the C++ program actually executes `d->wagTail()`, anything could happen. This is *undefined behaviour* (we will cover undefined behaviour later in this lecture).

Why should we prefer strongly typed languages? Well, they have two main benefits.
- They dramatically reduce software vulnerabilities (e.g. buffer overflows).
- They allow for early detection and fixing of errors/bugs.

{: .note }
The definition of strong typing is disputed. Many academics argue for a stronger definition (e.g. all conversions between types should be explicit, the language should have explicit type annotations for all variables, etc.). But ultimately while these definitions may make a languages type system stricter, they don't impact the languages type or memory safety.

## Weak typing
Weak typing is essentially the opposite of strong typing, in that it **does not** guarantee that all operations are invoked on objects/values of the appropriate type.
Weakly typed languages are generally neither type safe nor memory safe.

### Undefined behaviour
In a strongly typed language, we know that all operations on variables will either succeed or generate an explicit type exception at runtime (in dynamically-typed languages). But in weakly-typed languages, we can have undefined behavior at runtime!

Undefined behaviour is the result of executing a program whose behaviour is prescribed as unpredictable in the language spec.
Consider the following example in C++.
```cpp
// C++ example w/undefined behavior!
class Nerd {
public:
  Nerd(string name, int IQ) { ...}
  int get_iq() { return iq_; }
  ...
};

int main() {
  int a = 10;
  Nerd *n = reinterpret_cast<Nerd *>(&a); // reinterpret the integer as a Nerd object
  cout << n->get_iq(); // ?? What happens?!?!?
}
```
When we call the `get_iq` method on `n` (which is actually an `integer`), the program is going to crash!

It's tough to say whether or not a language is weakly or strongly typed just from looking at its behaviour in one situation. Consider the following example from a mystery language.
```perl
# Defines a function called ComputeSum
# In this language, @_ is an array that holds
# all arguments passed to the function

sub ComputeSum {
   $sum = 0;

   foreach $item (@_) {    # loop thru args
      $sum += $item;
   }

   print("Sum of inputs: $sum\n")
}

# Function call
ComputeSum(10, "90", "cat");
```
This outputs
```console
Sum of inputs: 100
```
It may seem like the mystery language is weakly typed, but in fact the mystery language is Perl, which is strongly typed!

Weak typing is the situation where an undefined result occurs because we apply some operation to a type that does not support it.  

In Perl, the `+` operator does support the `string` type. It will convert the `string` to an `integer`, if possible (e.g., if it holds all digits). If not, it'll convert the `string` to a value of zero. Then it'll perform the add. 

So while Perl does perform implicit conversions which might not do what you want, its behavior is **never undefined**.

### Classify that Language: Type Checking
Consider the following program which generates a runtime error:

```kotlin
fun processArgBasedOnType(x: Any) {
  when (x) {
    is Int -> print(x)
    is String -> print(x.length)
    is IntArray -> print(x.sum())
    else -> print((x as Dog).bark())  
  }
}

fun main() {
  var x = Person("Carey","Nachenflopper");
  processArgBasedOnType(x)   
}
```

Is this language strongly typed or weakly typed? Is it possible to determine if its statically typed or dynamically typed?

This is the error that is generated:
```console
Run-time: class Person cannot be cast to class Dog
```

<details>
<summary> Answer </summary>
It's strongly typed! We are prevented from performing an invalid cast from `Person` to `Dog`.
<br><br>
We are also able to determine that it's statically typed. In a dynamically typed language, a cast would not be necessary. This is Kotlin!
</details>

You might be wondering now: which typing strategy is best? The trend in industry is toward more **strongly-typed** langauges with **static type checking**. In fact, many companies are developing versions of popular dynamically typed languages with static type checking.
- Facebook has developed hack, a strongly and statically typed version of PHP
- they have also developed Flow, a static type checker for Javascript
- Microsoft has developed TypeScript, a strongly and gradually typed version of Javascript

In fact, just about the only weakly typed languages left are C and C++.


## Type casting, conversion and coercion

Type casting, conversion and coercion are different ways of explicitly or implicitly changing a value of one data type into another. 

For example, we can change the type of a variable using `static_cast` in C++.
```cpp
void convert() {
  float pi = 3.141;
  cout << static_cast<int>(pi); //type conversion
}
```

Before diving into the details of casting and conversion, it helps to learn the concepts of supertypes and subtypes.

### Subtypes and Supertypes
Often the types you are converting will be related to each other, for instance like `float` and `double`. Both types semantically represent real-valued numbers, but:
- `double` can hold every value a `float` can hold and more, due to having a relatively higher precision.
- any operation (e.g., +, -, *, /) you can perform on `double`s you can also perform on `float`s (but not necessarily vice versa)

So in language theory, we say that `float` is a subtype of `double`, or alternatively that `double` is a supertype of `float`.

More formally, given two types T<sub>sub</sub> and T<sub>super</sub>, we say that T<sub>sub</sub> is a subtype of T<sub>super</sub> if and only if
1. every element belonging to the set of values of type T<sub>sub</sub> is also a member of the set of values of T<sub>super</sub>.
2. _All_ operations (eg +, -, *, /) that you can use on a value of type T<sub>super</sub> must also work properly on a value of type T<sub>sub</sub>.
 - i.e., If I have code designed to operate on a value of type T<sub>super</sub>, it must also work if I pass in a value of type T<sub>sub</sub>.

{: .note}
Another way of thinking about this could be like two toddlers bragging on a playground:
Imagine the supertype saying:"Anything you can be, I can be" and the subtype saying:"Anything you can do, I can do".

Does this mean `float` is a subtype of `double` in C++? Yes! Since all operations that can be performed on a `double` can also be performed on an `float` (+, -, \*, /, etc.) **and** every `float` value is also in the set of `double` values.

{: .note}
To clear up the discussion from class about the type relations of `int` with either `float` or `double`:
`int` is NOT a subtype of `float` but `int` IS a subtype of `double` since `double`s have enough precision to represent all values that `int` can hold.

What about this example?
```cpp
class Person {
public: 
  virtual void eat();
  virtual void sleep();
};

class Nerd: public Person {
  virtual void eat();
  virtual void sleep();
  virtual void study();
};
```
Is `Nerd` a subtype of `Person`? Yes, since all operations that can be performed on a `Person` can also be performed on a `Nerd` **and** all `Nerd`s belong to the set of `Person`s. 

For a more tricky example, is `int` a subtype of `const int`? Yes, because all operations that can be performed on a `const int` can also be performed on an `int` and `int` and `const int` have the same set of values.

### Switching between types
Type conversion and type casting are used when we want to perform an operation on a value of type A, but the operation requires a value of type B.
There are two ways of converting between types - *conversions* and *casts*

#### Type conversions
A conversion takes a value of type A and generates a whole new value (occupying new storage, with a different bit encoding) of type B.
Type conversions are typically used to convert between primitives (e.g. float and int).

```cpp
void convert() {
  float pi = 3.141;
  cout << (int)pi; // 3
}
```
This is a conversion since the compiler generates a new temporary value of a different type.

#### Type casts
A cast takes a value of type A and treats it as if it were value of type B – no conversion takes place! No new value is created!

Type casts are typically used with objects.

```cpp
// Another casting example; treat an
// int as if it's an unsigned int!


int main() {
  int val = -42;

  cout << (unsigned int)val;
      // prints 4294967254
}
```
In the above example, `val` refers to the original `int` object, but interprets the bits as if it were an `unsigned int`.

Conversions and casts can be *widening* or *narrowing*.
- Widening means the target type is a super type, and can fully represent the source type's values.
- Narrowing means the target type may lose precision or otherwise fail to represent the source type's values. The target type could be a subtype (like `long` and `short`), or the two types could also have a non-overlapping set of values (like `unsigned int` and `int`).

Conversions and casts can also be *explicit* or *implicit*.
- An explicit conversion requires the programmer to use explicit syntax to force the conversion/cast
- An implicit conversion (also called coercion) is one which happens without explicit conversion syntax.

{: .note }
An implicit conversion or cast that is widening is called a *type promotion*.

### Explicit conversions and casts
When you're using an explicit conversion or cast, you're telling the compiler to change what would be a compile time error to a run time check.
```java
class Example
{
  public void askToCookFavoriteMeal(Machine m) {
    if (m.canCook() && m.canTalk()) {
      RobotChef r = m; // Line 5
      r.requestMeal("seared ahi tuna");
    }
  }
}
```
For example, at line 5, the programmer may know that converting from `Machine` to `RobotChef` is always safe, but a statically typed compiler can't know that. Therefore, the compiler will output an error. With an explicit cast (like in the example below), the compiler knows that the programmer wants to do this, and allows the code to compile.
```java
class Example
{
  public void askToCookFavoriteMeal(Machine m) {
    if (m.canCook() && m.canTalk()) {
      RobotChef r = (RobotChef)m; // Line 5
      r.requestMeal("seared ahi tuna");
    }
  }
}
```
If the language is strongly typed, then it will perform a runtime check to ensure the type conversion is valid. In weakly typed languages, however, improper casts/conversions are often not checked at run time, leading to nasty bugs!

Here are a few examples of explicit type conversions in different languages.
- C++
```cpp
// Explicit C++ conversions
float fpi = 3.14;
int ipi = (int)fpi;               // old way
int ipi2 = static_cast<int>(fpi); // new way
RobotCook *r = dynamic_cast<RobotCook *>(m);
```

{: .note }
Confusingly, even though `static_cast<int>(fpi)` is creating a new value (so it's performing a conversion), C++ calls it a cast

- Python
```python
# Explicit Python conversions
fpi = 3.14
ipi = int(pi)
```

- Haskell
```hs
-- Explicit Haskell conversion
fpi = 3.14 :: Double
ipi = floor(foo)     -- converts to 'Integral' super type
```

- JavaScript
```js
-- Explicit JavaScript conversion
fpi = 3.14
ipi = parseInt(pi) -- converts to int
```

### Implicit conversions and casts
Most languages have a set of rules that govern implicit conversions that may occur without warnings/errors. For instance, the slides have some associated with C/C++. When learning a new language, it helps to understand its implicit conversion policy!

Let's look at some examples of implicit conversions and casts in different languages.

- C++

```cpp
// Implicit C++ conversions
void foo(double x) { ... }

int main() {
  bool b = true;
  int i = b;  // b promoted to int
  double d =
    3.14 + i; // i promoted to double
  i = 2.718;  // 2.718 coerced/narrowed to int
  foo(i);     // i promoted to double
}
```

When we promote `i` to `double` in the statement `double d = 3.14 + i;`, it brings the all of the operands to a common super type so that addition can be performed. In such an expression with mixed types, the types of all variables must have "type compatibility" with each other.

{: .note }
In the above example, `i` is still an `int`, and it's value is `2`, not `2.718`. Compilers (especially recent ones) will often generate warnings for narrowing coercions which may not preserve the full source value.

- Python

```python
# Implicit Python conversions
i = 123 + True  # True promoted to int  (124)
f = 1.23
sum = i + f     # i promoted to float
```

- JavaScript

```js
// Implicit JavaScript conversion
str = "sk" + 8   // coercion of 8 to string
n = "10" * "15"  // coercion to numbers
```

- Java

```java
// Implicit (un)boxing in Java
int i = 10;
// implicit boxing
Integer boxed_i = i;
// implicit unboxing
int unboxed_i = boxed_i;
```

{: .note }
Haskell doesn't do implicit type conversions.

### Type casting in depth
Casting is when we reinterpret the bits of the original value in a manner consistent with a different type. No new value is created by a cast, we just interpret the bits differently. The most common type of casting is from a subtype to a supertype, for example, when upcasting from a subclass to a super class to implement polymorphism. Downcasting is another example, where we go from a super class to a subclass.
```cpp
// C++
class Mammal { ... }
class Person : public Mammal { ... };
class Nerd: public Person { ... };

void ask_hobbies(Person &p) { ... }

void date_with_nerd(Nerd &n) {
  ask_hobbies(n); // upcast Nerd to Person
}

void date_with_mammal(Mammal &m) {
 // downcast Mammal to Person
 Person& p = dynamic_cast<Person &>(m);
 ask_hobbies(p);
}
```
Here is an example of implicit casting.
```cpp
// C++
void print(unsigned int &val)
 { cout << val << endl; }

int main() {
   int j = -42;

   print(j);  // prints 4294967254
}
```
This cast simply reinterprets the value stored by `j` as if it were an `unsigned int`.

{: .note }
Many compilers will *not* warn about implicit casts when they are between unsigned and signed types - even though they are narrowing.

```cpp
// C++
void print(const string &s)
 { cout << s << endl; }

int main() {
   string s = "UCLA";

   print(s);
}
```
This cast implicitly converts from type `string` to `const string`.

We can also use casting to change the interpretation of pointers and read/write memory using a different type. For example, consider the following snippet of code in C++.
```cpp
void cast() {
  int a = 1078530000;
  int *ptr = &a;
  // Treat ptr as a float *
  cout << *reinterpret_cast<float *>(ptr); // prints 3.14159
}
```
The code treats `ptr` as if it is a pointer to a `float` (using `reinterpret_cast`), and when we dereference ptr, the bits are interpreted as if they were a `float`.

We can also reinterpret the value of an integer as a pointer (though this isn't recommended).
```cpp
void cast() {
  int a = 12340;
  // Treat a as a double pointer
  // Store value of pi at address 12340!
  *reinterpret_cast<double *>(a) = 3.14159;
}
```
So what's better, explicit or implicit type conversions? It depends! Explicit type conversions lead to more verbose code and is less convenient, but reduces the likelihood of bugs. Implicit type conversions makes code less verbose and is more convenient, but greatly increases the likelihood of bugs.

Here are a few final examples of casting and conversions.
```perl
$a = 5;
if ($a) {
    print("5 is true!");
}
```
From this snippet of code, we can infer that the language supports type coercion, since it does a narrowing coercion from an integer value `5` to a boolean value `false`.

{: .note }
The language is actually Perl.

In the following example, we are told that the program doesn't work if we remove the `float32` conversion.
```go
func main() {
  var x int = 5
  var y float32 = 10.0
  var result float32

  result = float32(x) * y // doesn't work if we remove float32()
  fmt.Printf("5 * 10.0 = %f\n", result)
}
```
From this, we can infer that the language requires explicit conversions between even comparable types (like `int` and `float`).

{: .note }
The language is actually Golang.

To summarize:
- conversion always generates a new value of the new type based on the old value 
- a cast takes the memory of a variable of type A and reinterprets it as type B
- there are three key properties of conversions/casts
    1. explicit or implicit
    2. widening or narrowing
    3. checked or unchecked

Here's a handy chart to help out with all the terminology!

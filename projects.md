*Note*: The project autograder link is optional. It lets you access ~20% of the test cases
that we run your project on to grade it so that you can test your project locally.

*Note*: we're trying a new approach of highly interactive project grading, where you:

- get your project graded **immediately on submission**
- submit **as many times as you want**
- get a subset of the test cases that we grade your project on
- (completely optional) are able to run a copy of the grading server locally

Since this is new, please let us know how effective this is, and how we can improve it. We want to see you succeed!

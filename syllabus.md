## Assignments

Assignments will take the form of homework and larger class projects. Homework will be graded on effort only. By "effort" we mean that you have attempted/solved all of the problems, provided solutions or partial solutions for each, and have documented where you got stuck on problems that you could not figure out. Class projects will be fully graded for correctness. All assignments will be due at 11:59pm on their due date. Homework and assignments that are turned in late will be penalized at the rate of 5% per hour past the deadline.

**Project and homework extensions will ONLY be granted for health issues and family emergencies.**

<!-- Finals week: -->
</div>
</details>

## Examinations

The midterm will cover material from the first five weeks of lectures and discussion sections. The final examination will cover material from the entire course. Missing the final for any reason will result in a final exam score of zero. **If you miss the midterm due to a health reason or family emergency**, your final exam score will be used to replace your missing score on the midterm. Missing the midterm for any other reason will result in a grade of zero on the midterm. We will NOT drop your midterm score (and weigh your final more) if you do poorly on the midterm. 

## Grading

Your grade in the course will be determined from your total score, although a final exam score below 40 may subject you to a failing grade regardless of your total score. This course will be “curved” as follows:

- 90% or higher always earns an A- or higher, 80% or higher always earns a B- or higher, etc. - this is regardless of the class median
- If the class’s median point total is lower than 80%, then the thresholds for earning each grade will be normalized downward as necessary

The total score is determined from the graded materials as follows:


| Item         | % of Grade                  |
|:-------------|:----------------------------|
| Project # 1  | 3% (graded on correctness) |
| Project # 2  | 7% (graded on correctness) |
| Project # 3  | 10% (graded on correctness) |
| Project # 4  | 10% (graded on correctness) |
| Homework     | 10% (graded on effort only) |
| Midterm      | 25%                         |
| Final Exam   | 35%                         |

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this class (I couldn’t find any that I liked). The class powerpoint slides will serve as our canonical source.

## Lecture and Discussion Sections

You will be responsible for all material covered in both lecture and discussion sections. **There will be new material covered in discussion sections, not just review of class material.** You are STRONGLY encouraged to attend discussion sections.

## Acceptable Collaboration/Academic Integrity

Homework: Since your homework is graded only based on effort, you may collaborate in any reasonable way you like that best enables you to learn the course material (simply copying solutions would not be a reasonable way to collaborate). Use the homework as means to prepare for exams and solidify your understanding.

Projects: You may discuss general approaches/ideas, but refrain from sharing source code or pseudocode. It is NOT acceptable to leverage ANY code from current or past CS131 projects in your solutions. Also, it is NOT acceptable to debug a classmate’s code for them. While it should be obvious, any attempts to misuse our grading servers or other infrastructure (e.g., hacking, exfiltrating data, etc.) is also prohibited and will be considered cheating, even if you do not succeed. DO NOT POST YOUR PROJECT solutions IN PUBLIC GITHUB REPOS until the course has ended, as other students may copy your solution and you will be implicated in a cheating investigation.

Tools: So long as you add a citation to your project solutions, you may leverage limited amounts of code generated by tools such as Copilot, ChatGPT or Bing in your project solutions (see our project specs for details - this does not include copying code from other students). You may also incorporate simple functions (e.g., ~10 lines of code) found on sites like StackOverflow, with appropriate citations.  

<!-- ```py
# The following code was generated by ChatGPT, with some modifications that I made
# prompt: give me a foo that ...
# response: def bar(...)
def foo(...)
  …
# End of ChatGPT code
``` -->
